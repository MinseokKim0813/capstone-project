// TODO:
// 1. Make the mathbar not sliding to the right or make it not cut when downloading in pdf
// 2. Sometimes user can enter space in mathmode, and when that happens it automatically switches to text mode without the slider update
// 3. When hovering over a symbol, show the english description of that symbol (e.g. < greater than)
// 4. Make the table button to support more than 5x5
6. Text mode selects the text automatically
7. For certain models (computers) I think the save pdf button is not working.
8. Expand table, insert table more than 5x5
